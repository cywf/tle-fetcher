# Security Review

## Rust crate audit

- Verified repository for Rust components by searching for `Cargo.toml` and `.rs` sources.
- No Rust crate was found, so there is no opportunity for `unsafe` Rust usage within this project at this time.
- Record retained to show audit completion for future reference.

## Logging hygiene

- Introduced structured logging with contextual metadata and automatic redaction of sensitive tokens (API keys, passwords, secrets).
- Structured logs are emitted as JSON for easier ingestion by security tooling while protecting confidential data.
