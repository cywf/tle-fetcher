# TLE Fetcher Utility

This repository contains a robust terminal-based utility for fetching up-to-date Two-Line Element (TLE) data for satellites from publicly available sources. It supports multiple data providers—CelesTrak and Ivan’s TLE API by default, with optional fallback to Space-Track and N2YO when credentials are provided. The tool can fetch single IDs interactively or process a batch of IDs from a queue file, validating and caching results.


## 🌐 Web Dashboard

A **static Next.js web dashboard** is included for interactive satellite pass prediction. The dashboard computes satellite line-of-sight (LOS) windows based on observer location, date, time, and time-on-target parameters.

### Features

- **Retro synthwave control panel UI** with analog gauges and LED indicators
- **Real-time pass computation** using SGP4 propagation (satellite.js)
- **Local TLE assets** with automatic CelesTrak fallback
- **Satellite metadata** from SatNOGS DB and CelesTrak SATCAT
- **Fully static** - runs on GitHub Pages without a server
- **Privacy-friendly** - no API keys required for basic functionality

### Live Demo

Visit the dashboard at: **https://cywf.github.io/tle-fetcher/**

### Local Development

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### How the Pass Algorithm Works

The dashboard uses the SGP4 (Simplified General Perturbations) propagation model to compute satellite positions:

1. **Load TLE data**: Fetches Two-Line Element sets from local assets (generated by CI) or CelesTrak
2. **Time window**: User specifies observer location (lat/lon), start time, and Time-on-Target (ToT) duration
3. **Propagation**: Computes satellite position every 10 seconds across the time window
4. **Visibility**: Determines when satellite elevation exceeds minimum threshold (default 5°)
5. **Results**: Lists all satellites visible during the window with first-seen, last-seen, and max elevation

The algorithm runs entirely in the browser using satellite.js for SGP4/SDP4 propagation.

### Data Sources

- **TLE Data**: Local assets (web/public/tle/*.tle) generated by CI, with fallback to CelesTrak GP/TLE API
- **Metadata**: SatNOGS DB API and CelesTrak SATCAT for satellite details (name, operator, country, orbit, etc.)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (tested with 3.8+).  
- Internet access to reach the TLE sources.  
- Optional: valid credentials for Space-Track (`SPACETRACK_USER`/`SPACETRACK_PASS`) and/or N2YO (`N2YO_API_KEY`) if you wish to use those services.

## Queueing and Batch Fetching

You can provide one or more NORAD catalog IDs on the command line, or point the script at a text file containing IDs (one per line). Blank lines and lines starting with `#` are ignored. An example file, `ids.txt`, is included in the repository:

```
# Queue of NORAD catalog IDs (one per line). Lines starting with '#' are ignored.
25544   # ISS (ZARYA)
43013   # TESS
```

```
# Queue of NORAD catalog IDs (one per line). Lines starting with '#' are ignored.
25544   # ISS (ZARYA)
43013   # TESS
```

To fetch TLEs for all IDs in a file and save them into the `tles/` directory, run:

```
python3 tle_fetcher.py --ids-file ids.txt --source-order celestrak,ivan --no-name -o "tles/{id}.tle"
```

The `--source-order` flag controls which sources are queried first. When using the `-o` pattern, placeholders `{id}`, `{name}`, and `{epoch}` are substituted for the actual values. The `--no-name` flag omits satellite names from the file content.

## Running Manually

Interactive mode is still supported for ad-hoc lookups. Run:

```
python3 tle_fetcher.py
```

and follow the prompts. You can also specify one or more IDs directly:

```
python3 tle_fetcher.py 25544 43013 --source-order celestrak,ivan --quiet
```

## Automated TLE Refresh via GitHub Actions

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/fetch-tles.yml`) is included. It can be triggered manually (`workflow_dispatch`) or runs nightly at 03:27 UTC. Scheduled workflows use POSIX cron syntax and always run on the latest commit of the default branch. The job performs two passes:

1. Fetch TLEs for all IDs in `ids.txt` from public sources (CelesTrak and Ivan API).  
2. If secrets for Space-Track or N2YO are configured, fetch using those sources with verification. Secrets are masked in the logs.

Fetched TLEs are stored under the `tles/` directory. The workflow commits updated `.tle` files back to the repository only when there are actual changes. Concurrency is configured so that only one nightly run executes at a time.

To trigger the workflow manually, go to the **Actions** tab on GitHub, select **Nightly TLE refresh**, and click **Run workflow**.

## Adding New IDs

To add new satellites to the nightly refresh queue:

1. Edit `ids.txt` and append the new NORAD catalog ID on its own line. Comments beginning with `#` are allowed.  
2. Commit the change to the repository. The next scheduled run (or a manual run) will fetch and update the corresponding TLE files.

## Rotating Secrets

If you use Space-Track or N2YO, store your credentials as repository secrets (`SPACETRACK_USER`, `SPACETRACK_PASS`, and/or `N2YO_API_KEY`). To rotate them:

1. Open the repository **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**.  
2. Update the secret values.  
3. Future workflow runs will use the new credentials automatically.

## Data Sources

This tool queries open TLE data sources such as CelesTrak and Ivan Stanojević’s TLE API. When configured, it also queries Space-Track and N2YO for cross-validation. Please respect each provider’s terms of service.

To fetch TLEs for all IDs in a file and save them into the `tles/` directory, run:

```
python3 tle_fetcher.py --ids-file ids.txt --source-order celestrak,ivan --no-name -o "tles/{id}.tle"
```

The `--source-order` flag controls which sources are queried first. When using the `-o` pattern, placeholders `{id}`, `{name}`, and `{epoch}` are substituted for the actual values. The `--no-name` flag omits satellite names from the file content.

## Running Manually
